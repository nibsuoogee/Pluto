# Snow Flake Bone Rake

An indie, survival horror experience where your main objective is to keep your body warm and your sauna free of zombie visitors.

In order to stay warm, you must keep the sauna oven stocked with energy rich timber, so make use of the nearby forest. 

Once the oven is fuelled and the fire a 'blaze, kick back and throw some water onto the rocks to raise heat and enjoy the steam.

*... "Who's that knocking on the door?"*
